    <h2>Tutorial</h2>
    <p>This is the help page of the Clipping Polygons program. On this page we give a short tutorial on how to use the program.
    You can also take a look at some help page for polygons and a short description of the clipping algorithms. Furthermore
    we present the file format used to save and open files of polygons.</p>
    <p>A clipping algorithm cuts a <i>candidate polygon</i> such that it is contained in a <i>clipping polygon</i>, i.e.
    the intersection of two such polygons is computed.</p>

    <h3>Window</h3>
    <p>The window consists of two parts: <ol>
      <li>On the left-hand-side you can see a coordinate system and in there all polygons
    added to the program will be displayed. The clipping polygons are display in blue, candidate polygons in red,
    clipped polygons in green and polygons which are currently created in yellow. Polygons which are
    currently selected in one the lists are highlighted.</li>
      <li>On the right-hand-side you can find all settings.
        <ol><li>In the top part you can choose to add a new polygon, either a
      clipping polygon or a candidate polygon (which will be clipped against the clipping polygon).</li>
      <li>In the central part you can find a list with all clipping, candidate and clipped polygons.
      If you select polygons in one of the three lists (you can select several using the Ctrl- or Shift-key) you can delete these selected polygons.
      This procedure, however, cannot be undone.  If you want to unselect a polygon you simply need to use the Ctrl-key and
      click on the polygon.

      <i>Before the clipping: One clipping polygon is selected (dark blue), and two candidate polygons are chosen (dark red).</i>
    </center>
      </li>
      <li>Finally in the bottom you can choose one of three <a href="algorithms.html">algorithms</a> which will be used for clipping the polygons.
      If you use <i>automatic</i>, then an algorithm which can handle the given polygons is chosen automatically.
      The clipping is started using the <i>Clip polygons</i> button. Then the chosen
      clipping polygon is used (one has to be selected) and all selected candidate polygons are clipped
      against the chosen clipping polygon. After the algorithm is done the result will be displayed in the report-textbox.

      <i>After the clipping: One clipped polygon is additionally selected (dark green), and we got two clipped polygons.</i>
    </center>
      </li>
      </ol></li></ol></p>
      <h3>Menu</h3>
      <p>In the menu you can get this help-page, a short <i>about</i> window and you can modify the list of polygons:
        <ol><li>Move: You can move the polygons which are currently selected into a specific list. For instance
        you can move a currently selected resulting polygon to the list of clipping polygons and use
        it as clipping polygon. This is particulary useful after opening polygons.</li>
        <li>Save: You can save all currently selected polygons for future use into a file.</li>
        <li>Open: You can open polygons from a file, e.g. polygons which you previously saved with this program.
          The file format is described in <a href="algorithms.html">File</a>.</li>
        </ol>
