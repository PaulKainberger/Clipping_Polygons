    <h2>Polygons</h2>
    <p>A polygon is an ordered list of points, called <i>vertices</i>, which are connected with
    a line, called <i>edge</i>. Here we describe some key concepts for polygons.</p>

    <h3>Convex</h3>
    <p>We call a polygon convex if all the inner angles are strictly less than 180 degrees.
    Equivalently this is the case if every line segment of points inside or on the border
    of the polygon is still inside or on the border of the polygon. We consider polygons
    with less than three vertices not convex.</p>

    <h3>Self-intersecting</h3>
    <p>A polygon is called self-intersecting if two arbitrary edges do not intersect. I.e. the
    only intersections of edges are the vertices themselves. For self-intersecting polygons the
    definition of the interior is more diffcult
    than for non self-intersecting polygons. There are several different rules which can determine
    if a point lies inside of the polygon. We use the <i>even-odd (winding number) rule</i>.</p>

    <h3>Interior</h3>
    <p>For determining if a point is inside a polgon we use the even-odd (winding number) rule. The
    SVG file format defines this rule as follows:</p>
    <p>&ldquo;This rule determines the "insideness" of a point on the canvas by drawing a ray from
      that point to infinity in any direction and counting the number of path segments from the given
      shape that the ray crosses. If this number is odd, the point is inside; if even, the point is outside.&rdquo;</p>
